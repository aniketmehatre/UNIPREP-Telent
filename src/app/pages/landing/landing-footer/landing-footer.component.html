	<h3>Refund & Cancellation Policy</h3>
	<p><strong>Last update: 1 July 2025 </strong> </p>

	<p>At UNIPREP Tech Ltd, we believe in complete transparency about how we handle payments, subscriptions, and user
		rights. Please read this Refund & Cancellation Policy carefully before purchasing or using any of our paid plans
		or services.</p>
	<hr>
	<h4>1. No Refunds</h4>
	<p>Once you have made a payment for any subscription plan, service, or upgrade through the UNIPREP platform, you
		acknowledge and agree that no refund will be issued under any circumstances. This applies to:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Monthly, quarterly, annual, lifetime, or other subscription plans</li>
		<li>One-time or recurring payments</li>
		<li>Upgrades or changes to an existing plan</li>
		<li>Partial or unused subscription time</li>
	</ul>
	<p>When you pay for a plan, you gain instant access to premium content, tools, and information that cannot be
		“returned” or retracted once delivered.</p>
	<hr>
	<h4>2. No Subscription Cancellation Once Paid</h4>
	<p>UNIPREP does not allow cancellation of a subscription once payment has been made. By completing payment, you
		agree to continue with the plan for its entire validity period. You may choose not to renew your plan at the end
		of its term, but you cannot cancel it for a refund or partial refund before the end of the paid period.</p>

	<p><strong>Key points:</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li>You cannot cancel your subscription mid-term for a refund.</li>
		<li>If you upgrade your plan, your previous plan is automatically discontinued, and the new plan begins
			immediately. No refunds are provided for the discontinued plan.</li>
		<li>If you do not wish to continue, simply do not renew the plan once it expires.</li>
	</ul>
	<hr>
	<h4>3. Why We Have a Strict No Refund & No Cancellation Policy</h4>
	<p>UNIPREP offers immediate digital access to premium resources, tools, and information. Because these services are
		intangible and accessible as soon as payment is confirmed, they cannot be reversed, reclaimed, or “returned.”
	</p>

	<p>Additionally:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>We offer clear plan information so you can make an informed decision before you pay.</li>
		<li>We keep our pricing transparent and fair for all users.</li>
		<li>We do not impose hidden fees or surprise charges.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>This policy ensures we can continue delivering high-quality, affordable educational and career services to all
		our users.</p>
	<hr>
	<h4>4. Free Trial Period</h4>
	<p>If you’re unsure whether a paid plan is right for you, we strongly encourage you to make full use of our free
		trial period (where applicable). The free trial gives you a chance to explore our features and understand
		exactly what you are paying for. If you do not wish to proceed, you must decide before making any payment, as
		refunds or cancellations will not be possible afterwards.</p>
	<hr>
	<h4>5. Questions or Clarifications</h4>
	<p>We want you to feel fully informed. If you have any questions about this policy or need help choosing a plan,
		please reach out to our team before making payment:</p>
	<p>📧 Email: <a href="mailto:info@uniprep.ai">info&#64;uniprep.ai</a></p>

	<p><strong>By using the UNIPREP platform and purchasing any of our services, you confirm that you have read,
			understood, and agree to this Refund & Cancellation Policy.</strong></p>

	<p>Thank you for trusting UNIPREP Tech Ltd with your career and study abroad journey.</p>

	<h3>Cookie Policy</h3>
	<p><strong>Last update: 1 July 2025</strong></p>

	<p>Please read this Policy together with the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.</p>

	<p>This Cookie Policy provides You with information explaining what types of cookies We use, why We use cookies, and
		how cookies enable the Site to function properly, so that You may not be able to experience the full
		functionality of the Site if You disable cookies.</p>

	<p>Unless otherwise defined all of the terms in this Cookie Policy have the same meaning as in the Terms of Use.</p>
	<hr>
	<h4>What are cookies</h4>
	<p>Cookies are text files, containing small amounts of information, which are downloaded to Your browsing device
		(such as a computer or smartphone) when You visit a website. Cookies can be recognized by the website that
		downloaded them — or other websites that use the same cookies. This helps websites to know if the browsing
		device has visited them before. The cookies allow the website to "remember" your actions or preferences over
		time.</p>
	<hr>
	<h4>What are cookies used for?</h4>
	<p>Cookies are used for lots of different purposes, like helping Us understand how the Site is being used by You,
		letting You navigate between pages efficiently, making Our Site work as You'd expect, remembering Your
		preferences and settings, and generally improving Your browsing experience. Cookies can also help to ensure that
		the marketing You see online is more relevant to Your interests.</p>
	<hr>
	<h4>What types of cookies do We use?</h4>
	<p>There are four types of cookies that may be used during Your visit to the Site:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>(a)</strong> Session cookies, which are stored only temporarily during a browsing session and are
			erased when You close the browser;</li>
		<li><strong>(b)</strong> Persistent cookies, which remain on Your computer for a fixed period of time (usually
			one year or more) and are not deleted when the browser is closed, for example Targeting cookies;</li>
		<li><strong>(c)</strong> First-party cookies, which belong to Us and are set by the Site; and</li>
		<li><strong>(d)</strong> Third-party cookies, which are placed on Your browsing device through the Site by
			another organization, such as a third-party analytics company.</li>
	</ul>
	<hr>
	<h4>First-party cookies</h4>
	<p>First-party Cookies mean Functional Cookies that are set by Our Site. We need to use such cookies, as they enable
		You to move around the Site and use its features and functionality, as well as allow Us to receive certain
		aggregated information about how the Site and Services are being used.</p>

	<p>These cookies include:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Performance Cookies:</strong> which collect information about how You use the Site, for example,
			which pages You go to most often and if You get error messages from certain pages.</li>
		<li><strong>Authentication Cookies:</strong> which help to identify You once You have logged in, for the
			duration of a session.</li>
		<li><strong>Operational Cookies (Your interface customization cookies):</strong> which allow the Site to
			remember the choices You make. For instance, the Site uses functionality cookies to remember Your language
			preference. These cookies can also be used to remember changes You have made to text size, font and other
			parts of pages that the user can customize.</li>
		<li><strong>Verification Cookies:</strong> which help Us to understand how You interact with the Site.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Please pay attention that We need all these cookies in order to provide You with the Services and to get the
		functional information about Your use of the Site in aggregated form. We use the data We get with the help of
		such cookies only for our internal purposes in order to be able to improve or develop Services. We will not be
		able to perform Services appropriately without these first-party cookies.</p>
	<hr>
	<h4>Third-party cookies</h4>
	<p>Third-party cookies are placed on the Site for the purpose of recognizing Your specific browser or remembering
		information specific to Your browser, when You return to the same site. We use third-party cookies to try and
		discern Your current interests so that We can deliver relevant, targeted advertising to You.</p>

	<p>These cookies include:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Targeting Cookies:</strong> these cookies are used to deliver advertisements that are more relevant
			to Your interests. Such cookies are also used to limit the number of times You see an advertisement as well
			as to help measure the effectiveness of an advertising campaign elsewhere on the Internet.</li>
		<li><strong>Analytics Cookies:</strong> third-party organizations on the Site may use cookies, beacons and other
			technologies to collect or receive information from Us and elsewhere on the Internet to provide analytical
			services.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Please note that We do not transfer any data to third parties and have no control over cookies placed on the Site
		by third parties — You should check the relevant third party's website for more information. You can delete or
		disable such third-party cookies in Privacy Options at the Site.</p>
	<hr>
	<h4>How long will cookies stay on Your browsing device?</h4>
	<p>The length of time a cookie will stay on Your browsing device depends on whether it is a "persistent" or
		"session" cookie. Session cookies will only stay on Your device until You stop browsing. Persistent cookies stay
		on Your browsing device until they expire or are deleted (usually one year or more).</p>
	<hr>
	<h4>How to control and delete cookies through the User's browser</h4>
	<p>The browser You are using to view the Site can enable, disable or delete cookies. To do this, You should follow
		the instructions provided by Your browser (usually located within the "Help," "Tools," or "Edit" facility). But
		if You set the browser to disable cookies, You may not be able to access certain parts of the Site. Other parts
		of the Site may also not work properly.</p>

	<p>All of the Personal Data We process according to this Privacy Policy is provided directly by You (for example,
		the Data You give Us during the registration or sending Us Your requests through the 'Contact Us' form) or
		received by Us from third parties. We can also collect information from a third party to create users on the

	<h5>Profiling</h5>
	<p>Profiling means gathering, automated processing, and analyzing the information about an individual or groups of
		individuals in order to evaluate certain personal aspects of such individuals.</p>
	<p>We use automatically collected log information as well as the other information You directly provide to Us to
		build Your profile.</p>
	<p>We can use profiling to produce relevant communication and provide a better experience for Our Users. With the
		help of profiling, We can target Our Services more effectively by getting and combining certain categories of
		Your Personal Data.</p>
	<p>For example, We can group Our Users according to their occupation (students or teachers/instructors) and provide
		them with relevant marketing and informational materials. Additionally, We may need such profiles for analytical
		and statistical purposes, in order to examine how Our Site and Services are used and to make certain
		improvements if needed. We can use Your profile with Your Personal Data to set the targeting advertisement with
		the help of third-party services (such as Facebook).</p>
	<p>You can also withdraw Your consent at any time if You do not want Your Data to be used in any of the listed above
		ways.</p>
	<hr>
	<h5>Marketing</h5>
	<p>We can, with consent, process Your Personal Data to provide You with information about Our activities and Our
		Services. In cases You gave Your consent on receiving marketing materials during the registration or just
		subscribe to newsletters about our Services on Our Site, We will send such marketing material to Your email.</p>
	<p>Please pay attention that if You did not choose such an option during the registration, We still can send letters
		via Your email, but only in cases when We are obliged under the law or under the contract to provide You with
		certain information (for example, when We change Our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, make any software updates,
		etc., We can inform You about it by sending You the email).</p>
	<p>We can also use Your Personal Data (with Your prior consent) to provide it to third-party services in order to
		set target marketing if You provide Us during the registration with consent to process Your Personal Data for
		marketing purposes, which also include targeting marketing.</p>

		purposes of the processing.</p>
	<h5>Right to rectification</h5>
	<p> You have the right to request correction of inaccurate Personal Data.</p>
	<h5>Right to erasure, "right to be forgotten"</h5>
	<p> This right means that You can request the removal of Your Personal Data We hold and process, but please pay
		attention that We can delete Your Personal Information only if there is no legal or regulatory obligation to
		retain it.
	</p>
	<hr>
	<h5>How we use and Share Your Personal Data</h5>
	<p>We only disclose Your Personal Data to third parties when We are obliged by law or other applicable legislation.

		emails, to third parties, which provide the service of setting up targeting ads (such as Facebook) for marketing
		purposes.</p>
	<p>Moreover, We will share some categories of Your Personal Data (which will include Your name and email) with the
		marketing automation services, when We make automated mailing to the emails of Our Users.</p>
	<p>For the purpose of this clause the term "Sub-processor" shall mean another data processor, including but not
		limited to group companies, subsidiaries, and auxiliary suppliers, engaged by the data processor to perform
		specific processing activities on behalf of the data controller. Please note that Your Personal Data is also

	<h5>CHANGES TO THIS POLICY</h5>
	<p>We may update this Privacy Policy in the future if needed to provide compliance with data protection laws and
